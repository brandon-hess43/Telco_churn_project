# Telco_churn_project

Project Overview
I am analyzing the Telco Churn data to identify key drivers for customer churn and develop predictive models to accurately forecast churn, giving insights into potential customer retention strategies.

Project Goals
Determine the main drivers contributing to customer churn
Use drivers to develop a machine learning model that identifies customers likely to churn
This information could be used to create actionable recommendations to reduce churn

Conclusion
Our original goals were to find drivers of churn and create a model to predict churn
We were able to determine that tenure, monthly charges, type of contract, and tech support all had a statistically significant correlation with churn
Using those features we were able to create a machine learning model that accurately predicted churn at a rate above baseline
Recomendations to minimize churn:
Incentivize annual and biennial contract types because the month-to-month contracts had a significantly churn rate
Ensure more customers sign up for tech support because customers with tech support churned significantly less
Reward new customers for staying with the company because less tenure had a higher rate of churn
Help customers keep their monthly payments low because higher monthly payments correlated with higher churn
If I had more time I would look into isolating a third variable like senior citizen, dependents, or partner.
I would also seperate the data of customers who had only internet and customers who had only phone service.
I would also look more into payment method because it looked like there was a significant correlation between electronic check payment and churn
